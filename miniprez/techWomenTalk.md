  | @p .left DC is fortunate to have a vibrant women in tech community. It serves an important purpose, but does not excuse the absence of women speakers at gender-neutral events. To think otherwise is to imply that the default, the normal, is male and women can/should be relegated to separate spaces.

# The industry is not an excuse
.grid
  | @figure(src="./img/DataVizDC/dataScience.png" width="100%")
  | @p .left This statistic is neither relevant nor true. There are multiple disciplines that provide valuable insight into data and tech. This unsourced statistic likely relies on either a too-narrow definition of data science or self-reporting. Both result in an underestimation of women in the field.

@p
  ## Be decent
  Act like there's a code of conduct even if the organizers aren't organized enough to have one.

@p
  ## Elevate women and minorities in your field
  This goes two ways: letting them know their work is awesome and letting your network know their work is awesome.

@p
  ## Voice your need for diversity
  Let organizers know you want more diverse speakers and spaces.
